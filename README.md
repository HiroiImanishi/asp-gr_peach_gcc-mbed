# What's this

TOPPERS/ASP Kernel and useful libraries for GR-PEACH have been distributed here.

## TOPPERS/ASP Kernel

The TOPPERS/ASP kernel is a sophisticated real-time kernel for embedded real-time systems.
ASP stands for Advanced Standard Profile which is improved version of the standard profile defined in μITRON4.0 specification. 

The detail specification of the ASP Kernel can be found at the following site.

- TOPPERS Next Generaton Specification (Japanese only): http://toppers.jp/documents.html
