## TOPPERS/ASP Kernel

TOPPERS/ASP kernel is a sophisticated real-time kernel for embedded real-time systems.
ASP stands for Advanced Standard Profile which is improved version of the standard profile defined in μITRON4.0 specification. 

TOPPERS/ASP kernel has been distributed with [TOPPERS License](http://toppers.jp/en/license.html).
The detail specification of TOPPERS/ASP kernel can be found at Refereces in this page.

# Software Development Enviroment

- Web compiler provided by RENESAS (Highly recommended for beginners)
  - You can get started programming without installing software in your computer.
    - [Get Started for beginners](https://github.com/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed/wiki/GetStarted)
  - No high functional debugging such like breakpoints, step-by-step execution, etc. are provided. If you want to use them, command line or IDE should be helpful for you.
- Command Line
  + Install development tools including ARM cross-compilers and source code in your computer.
    + Please read the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed/wiki/InstallationAndBuilding) for more details.
  + Download source code from GitHub as follows
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed.git
    $ cd asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed
    $ git submodule update -i 
```
- IDE
  - TrueStudio or Eclipse can be used for high functional debugging.
  - You can find the installation manual provided by attolic and A.I.Corporaiton.
